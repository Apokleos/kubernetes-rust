If you want to write an egress-only policy, you must explicitly specify policyTypes [ \"Egress\" ]. Likewise, if you want to write a policy that specifies that no egress is allowed, you must specify a policyTypes value that include \"Egress\" (since such a policy would not include an Egress section and would otherwise default to just [ \"Ingress\" ]).
